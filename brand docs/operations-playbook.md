## Content Templates & Hooks

### Instagram Carousel Template
- **Slide 1**: Big question or problem (one-liner hook)
- **Slides 2-4**: Short breakdown / mental model
- **Slide 5**: Practical action (30-60s task)
- **Last slide**: Call to engage ("Which of these is truest for you? Reply below.")

### Reel Hook Formula
- **0-3 seconds**: Shock/contrast sentence
- **Middle**: Show "before/after" or demo a prompt
- **End**: Tiny micro-ask (save/share/follow)

### LinkedIn Long-form Structure
- **Hook**: Short personal hook (1-2 lines)
- **Body**: 3 strong points with examples
- **CTA**: Provocative question + newsletter signup

### Ready-to-Use Hooks(These are examples and not the only hooks)
- "You were taught to wait for permission. Here's the better play."
- "The best skill today isn't coding—it's asking the right question."
- "Why should one company own your audience?"
- "If AI can replace you, it's not your fault — it's the system you were trained for."

## Content Repurposing Workflow

1. **Long-form LinkedIn** → Extract 3 carousels + 2 reels
2. **Reel transcript** → LinkedIn post + newsletter snippet
3. **High-performing comments** → Future posts / polls

### Content Pillars (Actionable)
1. **Wake-Up Call**: Problem diagnosis posts (carousels, reels, LinkedIn hot takes)
2. **The Bridge**: Mental models and frameworks (carousels, 3-6 minute LinkedIn reads)
3. **Toolkit**: Playbooks, prompts, templates, micro-challenges (reel demos, PDFs)
4. **Community Spotlight**: Member stories and co-created projects (stories, testimonials)

## Engagement Templates

### DM Quick Response (First Contact)
"Hey — thanks for reaching out. Love your interest. What's the one result you'd want in 30 days? If you share that, I can suggest one tiny action to try this week."

### Comment Engagement Template
"Solid point — have you tried reframing the problem as X vs Y? That often surfaces a different solution. Curious: which side do you see yourself on?"

### Engagement Playbook
- **Quick replies (<4 hours)**: Appreciation and micro-answer
- **Queue for human follow-up (<24 hours)**: Complex inquiries, partnerships, legal
- **Escalation**: Policy, legal, or partnership review → founder/comms lead

## Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (30s)
"Based Labs teaches and demonstrates how to reclaim agency in a world built for slower systems. We blend systems thinking, AI-augmented execution, and decentralization ethics to help people move from curiosity to real outcomes — not by selling shortcuts, but by teaching how to design, test, and scale meaningful projects."

### Core Messages
- **Primary**: Build agency. Design systems that scale. Use tools that amplify judgment.
- **Secondary**: Decentralization is an ethic that guides how we design products and communities.

### Supporting Narratives
1. **We start with the real problem** — Most people are taught the wrong first step; we show a better one
2. **We use modern tools responsibly** — AI is the amplifier, humans are the compass
3. **We grow through co-creation** — The community is the workshop and the market

### Vocabulary Guide
**Use**: agency, systems, design, iterate, AI-augmented, decentralization, ethical, ownership, practical
**Avoid**: Buzzwords without definition, speculative claims, absolute guarantees
