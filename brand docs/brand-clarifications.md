# Based Labs - Brand Clarifications & Context

## Audience Discovery Strategy
- **Primary channel**: Instagram - targeting people scrolling through content that resonates with systemic failures
- **Audience mindset**: Already questioning everything, dissatisfied with current systems
- **Stage**: Early questioners who haven't found clear alternatives yet

## AI Strategy
- **Dual approach**: 
  - Build AI-powered tools for the community
  - Educate people on effectively using existing AI tools
- **Philosophy**: AI as collaborator, not replacement

## Content Management Strategy
- **Solo operation**: No team initially, need systems for content generation and posting automation
- **Engagement approach**: Focus on DM responses for inquiries, selective comment engagement (not every comment)
- **Cross-platform**: Repurpose content between Instagram and LinkedIn, maintain consistent brand voice

## Monetization Timeline & Strategy
- **Pre-monetization goal**: 50k engaged Instagram followers + strong LinkedIn presence
- **Strategy**: Relationship first, monetization later
- **Ethical Revenue Principle**: If it doesn't empower the end user, we don't sell it
- **Revenue streams**: Premium learning paths, ethical brand partnerships, community-backed projects, digital tools, advisory services
- **Platform strategy**: Build owned channels (email, community spaces) alongside social platforms
- No product push until audience deeply understands and aligns with philosophy

## Future Community Evolution
- **Knowledge base**: Start free, add premium tiers later based on community needs
- **Platform expansion**: Move beyond Instagram when audience size demands it (determined by polls)
- **Physical events**: In-person gatherings for brainstorming/building together
  - Will require sponsors aligned with brand values and ethics
  - Not planned until community reaches sufficient scale
