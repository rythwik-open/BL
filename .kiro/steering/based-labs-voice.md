# Based Labs Brand Voice & Content Guidelines

## Core Voice Characteristics

**Tone**: Direct, confident, slightly rebellious, empathetic. Never preachy or condescending.

**Provocative Level**: 7/10 - Challenge systems and structures, not individuals or specific brands.

**Language Style**:
- Short, punchy sentences
- Active voice
- Conversational but authoritative
- Technical concepts explained simply

## Content Themes to Focus On

### Primary Themes (High Priority)
- **Agency over Permission**: People waiting for approval they don't need
- **System Inefficiencies**: Outdated rules that slow progress
- **Gatekeeping**: Traditional barriers to entry in tech, finance, education
- **Individual Empowerment**: Tools and mindsets for self-reliance
- **Decentralization Ethics**: User ownership vs corporate control

### Secondary Themes (Medium Priority)
- **AI as Collaborator**: Human-AI partnership, not replacement
- **Learning Acceleration**: Faster skill acquisition methods
- **Ethical Capitalism**: Merit-based systems vs quota systems
- **Future of Work**: Remote, autonomous, project-based work

### Avoid These Topics
- Direct criticism of public figures or specific companies
- Political partisanship (focus on systems, not parties)
- Financial advice (discuss principles, not specific investments)
- Absolute guarantees or "get rich quick" promises

## Content Structure Templates

### Hook Formulas
- "You're waiting for permission that will never come"
- "This rule made sense in 1950. It's destroying you in 2025."
- "Everyone does X, but here's why Y works better"
- "If [system] can replace you, it's not your fault—it's the system you were trained for"

### Content Frameworks
1. **Problem → Better Approach → Micro Action**
2. **Common Belief → Why It's Wrong → Alternative**
3. **System Analysis → Individual Workaround → Community Solution**

## Vocabulary Guidelines

### Use These Words/Phrases
- Agency, systems, design, iterate, build
- AI-augmented, decentralized, ethical, ownership
- Practical, actionable, framework, mindset
- Empower, enable, accelerate, optimize

### Avoid These Words/Phrases
- "Disruption" (overused)
- "Revolutionary" (hyperbolic)
- "Tokenize" (unless clearly defined)
- "To the moon" (crypto clichés)
- Corporate buzzwords without substance

## Content Quality Standards

### Every Piece Should:
- Provide immediate value (insight, tool, or perspective shift)
- Include a clear next action for the reader
- Reinforce Based Labs values
- Be shareable and discussion-worthy

### Length Guidelines
- Instagram posts: 50-150 characters for hooks, 150-300 for explanations
- LinkedIn posts: 300-800 characters for engagement
- LinkedIn articles: 800-1500 words for thought leadership

## Engagement Strategy

### Comments & Responses
- Always add value, never just acknowledge
- Ask follow-up questions that deepen the conversation
- Share relevant resources or frameworks
- Redirect criticism toward systems, not individuals

### Call-to-Actions
- "What permission are you still waiting for?"
- "Which outdated rule are you ready to ignore?"
- "How are you building agency in your work?"
- "What system needs redesigning in your industry?"
