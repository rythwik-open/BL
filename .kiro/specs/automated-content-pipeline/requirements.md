# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Based Labs Automated Content Pipeline is a comprehensive system that transforms content curation into published social media posts with minimal human intervention. The system will automate the entire workflow from trend monitoring and content generation to image creation, posting, and performance analytics, while maintaining the Based Labs brand voice and quality standards.

This system addresses the challenge of scaling high-quality, brand-consistent content creation for a solo operation targeting 50k Instagram followers and strong LinkedIn presence before monetization.
